Set Up A FileRouter
Creating your first FileRoute
All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
Max file size
How many files are allowed to be uploaded
(Optional) input validation to validate client-side data sent to the route
(Optional) middleware to authenticate and tag requests
onUploadComplete callback for when uploads are completed
To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to the File Router API.

app/api/uploadthing/core.ts
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next";
import { UploadThingError } from "uploadthing/server";
const f = createUploadthing();
const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function
// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({
    image: {
      /**
       * For full list of options and defaults, see the File Route API reference
       * @see https://docs.uploadthing.com/file-routes#route-config
       */
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 1,
    },
  })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);
      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new UploadThingError("Unauthorized");
      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);
      console.log("file url", file.ufsUrl);
      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;
export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;

Create a Next.js API route using the FileRouter
File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend serving it from /api/uploadthing.

app/api/uploadthing/route.ts
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/next";
import { ourFileRouter } from "./core";
// Export routes for Next App Router
export const { GET, POST } = createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
  // Apply an (optional) custom config:
  // config: { ... },
});

See configuration options in server API reference

Create The UploadThing Components
We provide components to make uploading easier. We highly recommend re-exporting them with the types assigned, but you CAN import the components individually from @uploadthing/react instead.

src/utils/uploadthing.ts
import {
  generateUploadButton,
  generateUploadDropzone,
} from "@uploadthing/react";
import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";
export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>();
export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>();

Add UploadThing's Styles
Tailwind v3
Tailwind v4
Not Tailwind
Wrap your Tailwind config with the withUt helper. You can learn more about our Tailwind helper in the "Theming" page

import { withUt } from "uploadthing/tw";
export default withUt({
  // Your existing Tailwind config
  content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}"],
  ...
});

Mount A Button And Upload!
Don't forget to add the "use client"; directive at the top of your file, since the UploadButton component needs to run on the client-side.

app/example-uploader/page.tsx
"use client";
import { UploadButton } from "~/utils/uploadthing";
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <UploadButton
        endpoint="imageUploader"
        onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
          // Do something with the response
          console.log("Files: ", res);
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );

💡 Optional
Improving SSR
UploadThing needs to get info from your server to get permissions info. Normally this means a loading state. We built an optional plugin to prevent that

Without SSR Plugin
No file chosenLoading...
With SSR Plugin
No file chosenReady
Allowed content
To add SSR hydration and avoid that loading state, simply render the <NextSSRPlugin /> hydration helper in the body of your root layout before the children.

app/layout.tsx
import { NextSSRPlugin } from "@uploadthing/react/next-ssr-plugin";
import { extractRouterConfig } from "uploadthing/server";
import { ourFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <NextSSRPlugin
          /**
           * The `extractRouterConfig` will extract **only** the route configs
           * from the router to prevent additional information from being
           * leaked to the client. The data passed to the client is the same
           * as if you were to fetch `/api/uploadthing` directly.
           */
          routerConfig={extractRouterConfig(ourFileRouter)}
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

If using the experimental ppr or dynamicIO features in Next.js 15, wrap the <NextSSRPlugin /> in suspense and call await connection() before rendering the component.

app/layout.tsx
import { connection } from "next/server"; 
import { Suspense } from "react"; 
async function UTSSR() {
  await connection(); 
  return <NextSSRPlugin routerConfig={extractRouterConfig(ourFileRouter)} />
}
export default function RootLayout(props) {
  return (
    <html>
      {...}
      <Suspense> // [!code ++]
        <UTSSR />
      </Suspense> // [!code ++]
      {...}
    </html>
  )
}
