**Solution:** 
1. Make sure you have a workspace selected
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser console for errors

### "I created a file but can't find it"
**Solution:** 
1. If you created it in a folder, expand that folder
2. If you created it at root level, it should appear in the Folders section
3. Files are stored in localStorage - check your browser storage
